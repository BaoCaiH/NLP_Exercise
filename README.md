# NLP Exercise

This is the repository for Arcada's Machine Learning for Descriptive Problems second assignment on NLP, assigned by Filip Ginter (Turku University Professor).

The datasets are mainly provided by the following repository https://github.com/TurkuNLP/intro-to-nlp, with an additional data pack from http://dl.turkunlp.org/intro-to-nlp.tar.gz and an external repository https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Vietnamese-VTB for the final task, to build a POS tagger.

All data are saved in the `Data` folder except for the additional data pack in `language-identification`.

Trained models were saved in `Model` though not all (only saved as check point for long training time).

I don't own any of these files except for the `.ipynb` file, the trained models and this `README`.
